 abstract = {© 2021 ELSEVIER. This article proposes a novel synchrophasor-based control scheme enabling controlled islanding, islanded operation and automatic re-synchronization of a distributed energy resource (DER) in a distribution network. The performance of the proposed control system is studied using a test power system model. The DER controller uses a centralized architecture, receiving phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements from both the transmission and distribution grids. In simulation, the frequency control function inside the proposed controller uses frequency estimates calculated using a new formula that exploits the bus voltage in rectangular form (real and imaginary values). The performance of the proposed frequency computation method is studied and compared with the conventional washout filter (WF) approach used by most power system software tools. The study also discusses why unwrapped bus angles are necessary to perform the automatic re-synchronization process. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated using both deterministic and stochastic load models, allowing the assessment of variability in distribution grids. The implementation of the proposed control scheme and the simulation of the test system is carried out leveraging rich features of Modelica language and the Open-Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL).},

 abstract = {© 2020 IEEE. Charging many electric vehicles (EVs) might cause violations of cable ampacities, statutory voltage limits, and substation transformer ratings in power distribution grids. Besides affecting mobility patterns, autonomous driving will open new perspectives in terms of interactions with the power grid. This paper explores the potential of autonomous EVs of reducing grid congestions thanks to the possibility of reaching the most suitable recharging locations autonomously. We first develop an algorithm for the coordinated charging of non-autonomous EVs accounting for grid constraints. We then augment its formulation by modeling the charging locations as decision variables of the problem, adopting an efficient linear mixed-integer program based on a linearized grid model and McCormick (exact) relaxations to handle some bi-linear terms appearing in the formulation. Considering the CIGRE' benchmark system for LV residential grids, we compare non-autonomous versus autonomous EVs and show that the additional degree of freedom coming from autonomous driving achieves reducing grid congestions.},
