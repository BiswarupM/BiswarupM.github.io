About me

Currently I work as a Doctorant at [Centre PERSEE](http://www.persee.mines-paristech.fr/Accueil/Presentation/) (Centre Procédés, Energies Renouvelables et Systèmes Energétiques) of MINES ParisTech - [PSL](https://www.psl.eu/), located in the southern France. Prior joining PSL, I was with [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/) in India, as Project Research Associate. I've remained a member and collaborator at [ALSETLab](https://alsetlab.github.io) under the department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in NY, USA.

My area of research includes: power systems dynamics, modeling, simulation and optimization. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in my research.
