Hi there, Welcome to my webpage!

<p align="justify">
I am a researcher interested in the integration of renewable resources with power and energy systems. I was born in India in 1992. I was affiliated with the <a href="http://www.persee.mines-paristech.fr/Accueil/Presentation/">Centre PERSEE</a> of MINES ParisTech - <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en">Universit√© Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL)</a>, located in southern France. Prior to joining PSL, I was associated with the <a href="http://iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> in India. I have also been a member and collaborator at <a href="https://alsetlab.github.io">ALSETLab</a> under the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in NY, USA.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I carry out research in the following areas: power systems; electric vehicles; modeling and simulation of cyber-physical systems; scheduling and planning for power grids. Feel free to shoot an email if interested in working with us.
</p>

*I use this platform to share my research activities. This website is still under development, soon it will be updated.*
