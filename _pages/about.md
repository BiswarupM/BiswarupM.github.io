Hi there, Welcome to my webpage!

Currently I work as a Doctoral researcher and Research Engineer at [Centre PERSEE](http://www.persee.mines-paristech.fr/Accueil/Presentation/) (Centre Procédés, Energies Renouvelables et Systèmes Energétiques) of MINES ParisTech - [PSL](https://www.psl.eu/), located in the southern France. I was born in India in 1992. Prior joining PSL, I was with [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/) in India. I've remained a member and collaborator at [ALSETLab](https://alsetlab.github.io) under the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in NY, USA.

I am a researcher in the field of power and energy systems. Also interested in the integration of renewable resources with the power systems. I currently carry out research in the following areas: power systems modelling, scheduling and planning, electric vehicles, simulation and optimization, power systems dynamics. Feel free to shoot us an email if interested in working with us.


*I use this platform to share my research activities. This website is still under development, soon it will be updated.*
