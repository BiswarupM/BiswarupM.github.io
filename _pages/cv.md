  I graduated with a Ph.D. in Energy and Process Engineering from 
  <a href="https://www.psl.eu/">Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL)</a> in France in 2023, 
  following an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering for Smart Grids from the 
  <a href="https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/">Grenoble Institute of Technology</a> in France, and a 
  B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the 
  <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/">University of Calcutta</a> in India.

  <br><br>

  My Post-Doctoral appointments from 2023 to 2025 were at the <a href="https://www.utc.fr/">Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)</a> in France and the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/">CEMSE Division of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a> in Saudi Arabia. During 2018 and 2019, I served as a Research Associate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the 
  <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>. I undertook my Master’s thesis and research internship at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 
  (EECS) at 
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Sweden in 2017; and earlier, in the summer of 2016, I completed a research internship at the 
  <a href="https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/">Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory</a> in France.

I currently serve as a reviewer for several leading journals and conferences in power and energy systems:

- <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=59">IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</a>  
- <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/sustainable-energy-grids-and-networks">Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks, Elsevier</a>  
- <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/electric-power-systems-research">Electric Power Systems Research, Elsevier (2019–present)</a>  
- <a href="https://pscc-central.epfl.ch/">Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC) series (2020–present)</a>
